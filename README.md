# Machine learning with a Wholesale customer dataset 

## Description
Using the wholesale customer dataset, we apply multiple different machine learning techniques to the data to see
which one 


## Goals and Visions
1. To learn more about the provided wholesale customer dataset
2. To reduce the number of dimensions our dataset has using PCA
3. Scale our dataset using both standard and minmax scaling
4. Apply the KMeans clustering technique to the dataset and see which set of modified features performs better

## How to run
After cloning this repository on your machine, head into the repos folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r  requirements.txt
```

It is preferred that you're using some sort of virtual environment manager, but the tool will still work without one.

After that, you can then run:

```bash
python sales.py -h
```

To get started!

## How to use

```bash
python sales.py -h      -> Shows the available commands  
python sales.py -c      -> Creates a correlation heatmap

```
